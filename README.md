# LSE_DA_COVID_analysis

## Week 2
8. Summarise (>200 words) any insights you've discovered as well as anything you would like to explore further.
- Did you notice anything interesting about the data?
- Does the DataFrame have a default index? 
- What are some of the initial insights you've discovered?
- How has the number of vaccinated individuals changed over time? What might these changes indicate? Include reasons to support your rationale.
- On which date(s) are there values missing, and from which columns and rows are these values missing? Which states or provinces do the missing values belong to?
- Is there anything unusual about the filtered Gilbraltar DataFrame? Include reasons to support your rationale.

The dataset provides detailed information during the pandemic. Interestingly, there are some missing values and unusual patterns in the values of deaths, recovered and hospitalised columns, which might be caused by human errors or miscalculation during the time as the pandemic was unexpected.
There is a default index in DataFrame starting with number 0. I chose not to create a new set of indexing as I used other functions to filter the relevant data. The initial insights I have discovered is the missing values and the max/min values in the file. By filtering and sorting the shape, type, and max/min of each column, I have developed a deep insight into the story during the time. Firstly, the number of the vaccinated individuals has changed a lot over time. The vaccinated rate reached to the highest in April and May 2021 (the highest point is recorded 69,619) and slightly goes down afterwards. From 2020-01-22, there was zero vaccinated individual until January 2021, showing that the vaccination scheme might start to roll over from the month. Moreover, there are some missing values in columns Deaths, Cases, Recovered and Hospitalised on the date 2020-09-21 and 2020-09-22 in cases. The missing values all belong to "Bermuda". Fortunately, there is no missing value in "Vaccinated" file.
Some unusual findings are discovered in Gilbraltar DataFrame. During the time appearing the highest death and case rate, the hospitalised values are showing as zero on both 2021-10-14 and 2021-10-13, which can be human errors or miscalculation. Also, some recovered rate seems missing as well as the values are zero. The data reflects that there is certain relevance among death, cases, recovered and hospitalised growth rate. When the rate of death and case increase, the recovered rate tend to decrease and the hospitalised value grows in the meanwhile.

## Week 3
•	What insights can be gained from the data? (Description of all regions, assumptions and concerns, trends or patterns you have observed.)
•	Are there limitations or assumptions that needs to be considered?
•	Make sure to provide a brief overview of the data and typical considerations at this phase of analysis.
•	Summarise (150–200 words) any insights you've discovered as well as anything you would like to explore further. For example:
1.	Which Province/State has the highest number of individuals who have received a first dose but not a second dose?
2.	Which Province/State has the highest percentage of individuals who have received a first dose but not a second dose.
3.	How has the number of vaccinated individuals and individuals who have received the first and second doses, changed over time? (Hint: You only need to describe what you observe in the data set at this point. Specify whether you are referring to a specific Province/State (e.g. Gibraltar) or the data set in general.)

I made some assumptions before answering the questions. When the syntax is not working, I rehearsed various scenarios to tackle the issue in different angles. I used basic mathematical formulas to analysis the data. Firstly, “Total Dose” was created to understand the country with highest vaccination rate. “groupby” and “aggregate” functions were used. The result shows that Gibraltar has the highest dose rate following by Montserrat and British Virgin Islands in terms of the total number. Interestingly, January to March is the month that people have highest vaccinated rate for 1st dose, whilst April and May are the two months with highest vaccinated rate for the second dose. The time difference can see that the dose application started in January for the first one, and April for the second one. “Sort_values” function was applied to analyse the topic. Gibraltar is found to be the country with the highest number of people took the first dose only. A new DataFrame “uk_perc” was created and “Use user-defined” function was applied to understand the percentage of the vaccination rate deeply. The result demonstrates that Turks and Caicos Islands has the highest percentage following by Isle of Man and Anguilla. Over time, the growth of the first dose rate started from January and reached to the top in March; while the second one grew from April and reached to the top in May. In short, Gibraltar has the best performance of the vaccination rate. Turks and Caicos Islands can be encouraged to take the second dose to improve the percentage.

## Week 4
Based on the 1st bar chart, the percentage of vaccinated is much higher than partially vaccinated cross all regions, demonstrating that most people in the UK have been fully vaccinated.
Regarding death rate, there are some outliers found when running the sum of deaths cross province/state, which cause the distribution skewed. Thus, groups “Anguilla, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha and others” were removed. Based on the line chart, Bermuda and Isle of Man seem have not reached to the peak in October 2021, whilst other regions are presented more stable with their death rates. Also, the percentage of the fully vaccinated rates shows none of the regions has reached 100%. This explains that the government should focus on Bermuda and Isle of Man for the promotion of the second doses to cease the death rate.
Regarding recoveries, British Virgin Island and Gibraltar embrace the highest number. The recoveries cross regions have not consistent as the number drop rapidly approximately from August/September 2021, which can be assumed that less individual was tested positive; thus, less recovered numbers were reported.
The error line appears after the date concerts to month, noting that the number contains a certain level of confidence interval. The smoothness of the lines, the accuracy of the raw data and more annotates on the charts can increase the quality of my visualisation.
The visualisation can help the government to determine the targe regions for the campaign with direct and clear information. The bar chart provides the comparation of partially and fully vaccinated rate cross regions and the line charts informs the trend of death and recovery rate over time. It is easy for the government to spot the relevant information such as maximum, minimum in numbers and regions in different colours.

## Week 5

I decided to keep my approach and Norah’s one as I find they can apply to different scenarios. I chose to use “string.extractall()” function to extract all hashtags and converted the series to a DataFrame. I was struggling with this part previously as I didn’t notice that some functions can only be applied to strings/series instead of other types. The result displayed the top 30 hashtags in the file. To filter the hashtags with covid-related strings, I used “str.contains()” function and some hashtags were excluded as the count is relatively low. Only top 10 was displayed. Formatting was applied to make the chart easier to read. Finally, the chart demonstrates that “#COVID19, #CovidIsNotOver, #coronavirus, #covid19/Covid19 and #COVID/covid” are the hottest hashtags, which #COVID19 was used for nearly 2,000 times, following by #CovidIsNotOver. The hashtag “#CovidIsNotOver” is quite interesting as people who tagged this might have a different view towards current vaccination scheme or other ideas towards post-pandemic lives. I would apply sentiment analysis to understand the cyber behaviour more.
Norah’s approach provides more information of the content in each tweet. The result displays the relevant information between tweets. I would investigate the content of the tweets to analyse the corelation. For example, “Pregnant women have a low risk of having severe symptoms” shows how “risk” is related to “cases” and the sentiment should be relatively positive. In this approach, we could understand people’s reaction towards the government scheme and future for post-pandemic lives.
